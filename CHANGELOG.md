## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release

This is the first complete release of the PPE polling system, implementing all core protocols from the "PPE Polling: Proof of Private Effort for Sybil-Resistant Polling Systems" research paper.

**What's Included:**
- Full end-to-end PPE polling protocol implementation
- Complete frontend and backend applications
- Comprehensive testing and simulation framework
- Production-ready deployment configuration
- Extensive documentation and guides

**Key Capabilities:**
- Sybil-resistant polling without central authority
- Public verifiability of all poll results
- Real-time collaborative challenge protocols
- Advanced graph analysis for attack detection
- Modular architecture for future extensions

**Current Limitations:**
- In-memory storage (not persistent across restarts)
- Single PPE type (symmetric CAPTCHA)
- Pseudonymous voting (votes linked to public keys)
- Browser-based deployment only

**Future Roadmap:**
- Database persistence for production deployments
- Additional PPE types (audio, image recognition, proof-of-work)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for vote privacy
- Mobile application support
- Scalability optimizations for large-scale deployment
