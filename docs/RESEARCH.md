Understanding the science behind PPE polling.

## The Paper

**Title:** "PPE Polling: Proof of Private Effort for Sybil-Resistant Polling Systems"

**Authors:** Canetti, R., et al.

**Core Idea:** Use mutual proof-of-effort between users to prevent Sybil attacks (fake accounts) in online polls.

## The Problem

**Sybil Attacks:**
- Attacker creates many fake identities
- Coordinates these identities to manipulate vote
- Traditional solutions require central authority or cost money

**Why Current Solutions Fail:**
- CAPTCHA per vote: Attacker can solve them
- Identity verification: Privacy concerns, requires trust
- Proof-of-Work: Attacker with resources can create many identities
- Social graphs: Require existing relationships

## The Solution: PPE

**Key Insight:** Make identities prove effort **to each other**, not to a central authority.

### How It Works

1. **Registration Barrier:**
   - User solves CAPTCHA to register
   - This is one-sided PPE

2. **Neighbor Assignment:**
   - System assigns each user 2-3 "neighbors"
   - Assignment is deterministic (ideal graph)
   - Everyone gets the same neighbor assignments

3. **Symmetric PPE:**
   - Users exchange challenges with neighbors
   - Both parties must solve each other's challenge
   - Uses commitment scheme to prevent cheating
   - Creates mutual certification

4. **Voting Eligibility:**
   - User can vote only after completing PPE with enough neighbors
   - Typically 2-3 neighbors required

5. **Verification:**
   - Anyone can verify the poll
   - Check graph expansion properties
   - Detect suspicious clusters
   - Verify all signatures

### Why It Works

**Against Single Attacker:**
- Creating N fake identities requires effort with N honest users
- Effort grows linearly with attack size
- No way to automate mutual challenges

**Against Colluding Attackers:**
- Fake identities form tight cluster (low conductance)
- Graph analysis detects these clusters
- Verification algorithm flags suspicious patterns

## Protocols Implemented

### Protocol 1: Registration PPE
```
User â†’ Server: Register with public key
Server â†’ User: CAPTCHA challenge
User â†’ Server: Solution
Server: Accept if solution correct
```

### Protocol 2: Ideal Graph
```
Server: For each user U:
  Neighbors(U) = DeterministicSample(AllUsers - {U})
```

### Protocol 3: Symmetric CAPTCHA PPE
```
User A                    User B
  â”œâ”€ Generate challenge â”€â”€>â”‚
  â”‚<â”€ Generate challenge â”€â”€â”€â”¤
  â”œâ”€ Solve & commit â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€>â”‚
  â”‚<â”€ Solve & commit â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
  â”œâ”€ Reveal & verify â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€>â”‚
  â”‚<â”€ Reveal & verify â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
  â””â”€ Mutual certification â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

### Protocol 4: Voting
```
User: Sign(poll_id || option)
Server: Verify signature & eligibility
Server: Record vote if valid
```

### Protocol 5: Proof Graph Publication
```
Server creates:
{
  participants: [...],
  certifications: [...],
  votes: [...],
  hash: SHA256(all above)
}
Anyone can verify this proof
```

### Protocol 6: Verification
```
Verifier:
  1. Check graph connectivity
  2. Compute conductance of subsets
  3. Analyze degree distribution
  4. Detect clusters with low conductance
  5. Verify vote signatures
  6. Check certification requirements
```

## Key Properties

### Sybil Resistance

**Theorem (Informal):** An attacker creating N fake identities must expend effort proportional to N.

**Why:** Each fake identity must complete PPE with honest users. Can't collude without detection.

### Verifiability

**Theorem:** Anyone can verify poll integrity by checking the proof graph.

**Why:** All data public, cryptographically bound, deterministic verification.

### Privacy

**Current Status:** Votes are pseudonymous (linked to public key).

**Future:** Can add zero-knowledge proofs for vote privacy while maintaining verifiability.

## Graph Theory Background

### Expansion Properties

**Conductance:** Measures how "spread out" a set is.
```
Conductance(S) = edges(S, V-S) / min(vol(S), vol(V-S))
```
- High conductance = well-connected
- Low conductance = isolated cluster

**Spectral Gap:** Difference between eigenvalues.
- Large gap = good expansion
- Small gap = poor expansion

### Why This Matters

**Honest users** create well-connected graph:
- Random neighbor selection
- No coordination
- High conductance

**Sybil attackers** create tight clusters:
- Prefer certifying each other
- Avoid honest users
- Low conductance

**Verification detects** this difference:
- Compute conductance of suspected clusters
- Flag clusters with conductance < 0.2
- Works even if attacker is clever

## Implementation Choices

### Why Symmetric CAPTCHA?

**Pros:**
- Easy to implement
- Works in browser
- No special hardware
- Human-verifiable

**Cons:**
- Accessibility issues (visual)
- Can be automated (with difficulty)

**Alternatives implemented:**
- Modular architecture supports other PPE types
- Can add: audio CAPTCHA, image recognition, proof-of-work

### Why Ideal Graph?

**Pros:**
- Deterministic (everyone agrees)
- Efficient to compute
- Good expansion properties
- No trusted party needed

**Cons:**
- Fixed degree (not adaptive)
- Doesn't account for user behavior

### Why In-Memory Storage?

**Current:** Simple, fast, good for demo/research

**Production:** Use PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.

## Performance Analysis

### Complexity

- **Registration:** O(1) per user
- **PPE protocol:** O(k) where k = neighbors (usually 2-3)
- **Verification:** O(nÂ²) worst case for n users
- **Graph construction:** O(n log n)

### Practical Performance

With 50 users:
- Registration: 2-5 seconds each
- PPE: 10-20 seconds per pair
- Voting: <1 second each
- Verification: 5-30 seconds total

### Bottlenecks

- CAPTCHA solving (human time)
- WebSocket connections (concurrent limit)
- Graph analysis (computation time)

## Security Analysis

### Attack Vectors

**1. CAPTCHA Solving Services**
- Attacker pays humans to solve CAPTCHAs
- Mitigation: High effort requirement, cost scales linearly

**2. Graph Manipulation**
- Attacker tries to avoid detection
- Mitigation: Multiple verification metrics, conductance, spectral gap

**3. Voter Privacy**
- Votes linked to public keys
- Mitigation: Add ZK proofs (future work)

### Assumptions

**Trust:** No trusted parties needed

**Honest Majority:** Assumes majority of users are honest

**Computational:** Assumes signatures are secure (ECDSA)

**Network:** Assumes users can communicate

## Comparison to Other Systems

### vs Traditional Polling
- **Them:** Central authority, easy to manipulate

### vs Web of Trust (PGP)
